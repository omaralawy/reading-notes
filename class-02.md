# css 
CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside as if it appear in its own box .
Rules are made up of selectors and declarations.
Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. 
CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.
# js
*A script is made up of a series of statements. Each statement is like a step in a recipe.*
Scripts contain very precise instructions.
**Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of information used in the script.**
Arrays are special types of variables that store more than one piece of related information. 
JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), 
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 
Expressions evaluate into a single value. 
and finaly
Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value
# loops
Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next. 
Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands. 
Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators. 
if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false. 
switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match). 
Data types can be coerced from one type to another. 
All values evaluate to either truthy or falsy nothing els .
