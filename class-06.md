## object model
The browser represents the page using a dom tree. 
Dom trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes. 
To select element nodes by their id or class attributes.
Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a Nadelist. 
From an element node, you can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and i nnerHTML.
An element node can contain multiple text nodes and child elements that are siblings of each other. 
In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is inconsistent.
