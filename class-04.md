# functions
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a
specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can
reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).
# VARIABLE SCOPE 
The location where you declare a variable will affect where it can be used
within your code. If you declare it within a function, it can only be used
within that function. This is known as the variable's scope.
# links
Links are created using the  X <a> element. 
The  X <a> element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is  X best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
You can create links to open email programs with an  X email address in the "to" field.
You can use the  X id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.
# lay out 
<div> elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you  X specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
The float property moves content to the left or right of the page and can be used to create multi-column layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts. X
Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,  X and indicate what the site is about within the top 600 pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
Grids help create professional and flexible designs. X
CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks. X
You can include multiple CSS files in one page
